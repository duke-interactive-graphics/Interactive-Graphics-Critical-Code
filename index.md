Introduction to interactive graphics programming for artists. Explores object-oriented programming via the Processing programming environment as well as historical and theoretical appreciation of interactivity and computer graphics as artistic media. Combines discussions of key concepts from the readings with hands-on Processing projects and critiques. No previous programming experience needed


## Over the course of our semester together we will:

* Learn programming fundamentals and develop a codebase in both p5.js (javascript) and Processing (java).
* â€¢	Develop interactive interfaces through physical computing, computer vision, and audio input.
* Engage critically with interface design, physical computing, and new media discourse.
* Develop and expand critical creative practices that engage contemporary technology concepts


No prerequisites beyond a willingness to work hard, collaborate, learn, tinker, and play.
