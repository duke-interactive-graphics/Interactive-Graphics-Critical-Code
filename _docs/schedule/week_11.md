# Intro
New Media artist leverage internet connected devices to create works that connect people and environments. In this section, we'll be exploring how to develop backend services in Node.js to connect our sketches to the physical world. We'll explore mqtt, websockets, OSC messages, and API's to drive data in and out of our works. 

# Code Assignment
We should now have Node.js and Express.js installed on our computers, and have a general sense of how to create a p5.js sketch with a Node.js backend.

* Task: Work with your partner to use websockets to connect eachothers sketches. Create sketches that leverage these connections to drive the concept of your pieces.

* Task: Prepare one of the works that you have created to this point to be displayed online in our online gallery exhibition. Create a 'GitHub Page' and send me the link to the address.


# Blog Post

* Task: Write a short blog post on at least two pieces that use physical computing or connected messaging to drive the concept of thier works.
