# Code Assignment
A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs or displays "Hello, World!" to a user. Being a very simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working program.[1] It is often the very first program people write when they are new to a language.

For our "Hello World" assignment in p5.js, we'll be creating some basic visual output and putting it on the screen. As p5 is meant for  visual display, we'll create a few primitive shapes and add them to the canvas. 

  * Task: Follow the "Hello World" tutorials and create your first p5.js sketch. Push it to Github and use GitHub Pages to make it visible.  Play with color, shape, images or text elements to create a visually striking piece. Email me the link.

# Blog Post
* Task: Document the piece that you created. How is this work leading to future projects? What concepts are you thinking about pursuing and how are those concepts reflected in this static piece?
