# Code Assignment
A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs or displays "Hello, World!" to a user. Being a very simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working program. It is often the very first program people write when they are new to a language.

For our "Hello World" assignment in p5.js, we'll be creating some basic visual output and putting it on the screen. As p5 is meant for  visual display, we'll create a few primitive shapes and add them to the canvas. 

  * Task: Take the "Hello World" sketch that we created and extend it. Play with color, shape, images or text elements to create a visually striking piece. Be prepared to show the class how you've extended the sketch.

# Blog Post
  * Task: Write a short blog post in Microsoft Word on at least two pieces that youâ€™re interested in. What drew you to them? What do you find interesting about them? How are users expected to interact with the pieces? Download a few pictures of each piece and include links. No more than a paragraph for each piece.
