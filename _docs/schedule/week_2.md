# Code Assignment
We should now understand how to add primitive shapes to the canvas and give them colors. We should be able to place them on the canvas grid and change their width and height. Next we'll be learning how to add other elements to the canvas such as text and images. These elements follow a similar pattern to primitive shapes. 

* Task: Add some text and images to the canvas. Play with color, shape, images and text elements to create a visually striking piece. Layer elements, and begin conceptualizing a project that you might like to pursue later in the semester. Can we sketch this project with static elements from what we have learned so far?

# Blog Post
* Task: Document the piece that you created. How is this work leading to future projects? What concepts are you thinking about pursuing and how are those concepts reflected in this static piece?
