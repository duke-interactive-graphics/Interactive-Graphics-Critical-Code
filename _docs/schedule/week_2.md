# Intro
A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs or displays "Hello, World!" to a user. Being a very simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working program.[1] It is often the very first program people write when they are new to a language.

# Code Assignment

# Blog Post 
In class we explored many different ways in which artists, designers, entrepreneurs, and engineers engaged creatively with code. Find some more (at least one) examples of a creative use of code.

  * Task: Write a brief blog post about the artist and their work. What got you excited about this project. Could you implement a similar project throughout this class? How long did this project take to develop. Engage critically with the work. Who is the work for and who is benefiting from it. How/where is the work being displayed, who has access to it?
