# Intro
Data visualization can help artists tell stories and construct interactive narratives that drive new media pieces. In this section, we'll take a look at artist using data to drive pieces, and discuss how data can drive chance, narrative, and/or interaction. We'll learn how to work with static CSV and XML files, external API's, and web sockets for real-time data visualization.

# Code Assignment
We should now understand how to read cvs and xml files into our sketches for visualization, as well how to show basic representations of those data points in our sketches.

* Task 1: Read a CVS file of data into your sketch and create a visualization. Display the data leveraging classes and arrays, build in some user interaction.

* Task 2: Find a data source you would like to work with in upcoming assignments. Create a preliminary storyboard of a narrative or interaction you would like to construct with this data

# Blog Post

* Task: Write a short blog post on at least two pieces that use data in some way. Keep in mind that data is not restricted to visualization, and can be any representation or transformation of data.
