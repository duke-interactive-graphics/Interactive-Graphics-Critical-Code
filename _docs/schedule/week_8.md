# Intro
Data visualization can help artists tell stories and construct interactive narratives that drive new media pieces. In this section, we'll take a look at artist using data to drive pieces, and discuss how data can drive chance, narrative, and/or interaction. We'll learn how to work with static CSV and XML files, external API's, and websockets for real-time data visualization.

# Code Assignment
We should now understand how to read cvs and xml files into our sketches for visualization, as well how to show basic representations of those data points in our sketches.

* Task: Leverage if-statements, for-loops to create a piece that employs chance operations. Allow for the code to flexibly output different versions on each refresh. Record the output or export static files. 

# Blog Post

* Task: Write a short blog post on at least two pieces that use data in some way. Keep in mind that data is not restricted to visualization, and can be any representation or transformation of data.
