# Intro
Algorithmic design is a cornerstone of the interaction of art and computation. Artist have long used chance operations and algorithm to create expressive output and drive the creative process. Throughout this section, we will engage with the artistic lineage of chance and algorithm in artistic practice. We'll expand the skills that we've developed throughout our 'Hello World' section to understand how to leverage code to produce expressive operations. In this section, we'll engage with if-statements, for-loops, classes, and arrays to produce our own chance operations. 

# Code Assignment
We should now have a grasp of basic functions, as well as a handle on how to build out basic p5 drawings.

* Task: Leverage if-statements, for-loops to create a piece that employs chance operations. Allow for the code to flexibly output different versions on each refresh. Record the output or export static files. 

# Blog Post

* Task: Write a short blog post on at least two pieces that use chance operations for creative output.
