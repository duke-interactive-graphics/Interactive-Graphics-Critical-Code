# Intro
An important part of software development is setting up your environment with the correct software versions. As this is the first week and we're all working on different computers, creating a  similar environment will allow us to collaborate and share ideas and reduce confusion. There are a few things that we'll need to get set up before we dive into developing out first projects.

1. A text editor
2. A fresh python install 
3. A working directory our projects
4. A GitHub account and proper git install
5. The P5 libraries


### A Text Editor
A text editor for coding is a lot like Microsoft Word for writing papers. It allows us to write cleanly formatted code and provides us with additional tools to develop our projects. In this class, I'll let you use whatever text editor you feel most comfortable with. Please keep in mind that your text editor is the main way you'll interact with your code and picking a suitable one is important . Here are a list of popular text editors from least to most advanced:

* Visual Code (beginner)
* Atom (beginner)
* Sublime Text (beginner)
* Text Wrangler (medium)
* MacVim (advanced) 
* Vim (advanced)
* Emacs (advanced)

Download one of the text editors listed above (I'll be using Visual Code for the remainder of the course).

### A Fresh Python Install
While we wont be using python until later in the course, we will need "python simple server" to launch our P5.js code. Later in the semester we'll also learn a little bit of python for data collection and analysis, and for those of you interested in developing full stack web applications (not a requirement). 
  
  * Task: Navigate to Anaconda (link) and download and install the latest anaconda package for python 3.6.

### Working Directory for our Projects
Getting use to using the terminal is an extremely important skill for developers. The terminal is  like your computer, but without a visual interface, it allows you to quickly navigate your computer, make directories and files, and launch applications. On a Mac, your terminal is located in Applications --> Uitilities --> Termianl.app.

Follow the terminal tutorial to get a sense of how to move about and make directories. Check the terminal command cheat sheet if you need help with commands.
  
   * Task: Make a directory on your desktop from terminal. Make a file called "README.md"

### A Github Account
Github is a place to store and keep track of code, and is an important tool for anyone developing projects. It allows developers to keep track of versions of their work, create new versions (branches) to try out new ideas, and share code amongst a team. It's also a social network to connect with other developers and collaborate on projects. Github is a great place to find new projects and repositories and share yours with the world
  
  * Task: Create a Github account. Follow the Github tutorial to push your first README.md file to GitHub.

### Download the P5.js libraries
Well start this semester by learning p5js. As such we'll need a copy of the libraries locally on our computer. 
  
  * Task: Navigate to P5.js website, and download the libraries. Create a new folder inside your working directory called "libraries" and put the p5 libraries inside.



# Code Assignment
A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs or displays "Hello, World!" to a user. Being a very simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working program.[1] It is often the very first program people write when they are new to a language.

For our "Hello World" assignment in p5.js, we'll be creating some basic visual output and putting it on the screen. As p5 is meant for  visual display, we'll create a few primitive shapes and add them to the canvas. 

  * Task: Follow the "Hello World" tutorials and create your first p5.js sketch. Push it to Github and use GitHub Pages to make it visible. Email me the link.
