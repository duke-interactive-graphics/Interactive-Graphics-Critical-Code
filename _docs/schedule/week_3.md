# Code Assignment
We should now have a good sense of how to add primitive shapes and colors to the screen, as well as an understanding of the canvas grid and how to place object appropriately on the canvas.  We should also have a sense of the landscape of creative coding, and how to engage critically with intersection of code and creative design

* Task: Push your hello world work towards a creative concept or idea. This should go beyond random primitive shapes and should embody a concept that you are interested in engaging with or idea you'd like to express. If your feeling comfortable feel free to include images or user interaction, though this is not required. 

# Blog Post
This is the conclusion of the "Hello World" section of the semester. We should have learned a little about environment setup, Github, and coding in P5js.

* Task: How did it feel? Are there any parts that were confusing or that you particularly struggled with? Are there any areas that moved too slowly or quickly for you? What is your plan of attack moving forward to overcome these obstacles?
