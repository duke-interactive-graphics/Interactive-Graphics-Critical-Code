Overview

This course is an introduction to computer programming (writing code) within the context of the visual arts. The concepts and skills taught in this course set a foundation for future Design Media Arts courses about the internet (161), game design (157), and media arts (159A, 171).

Content

As a Designer or artist, why would I want to write software? Software influences all aspects of contemporary visual culture. Many established artists have integrated software into their process. Many prominent architects and designers not only use software, they commission custom software to help them realize their unique ideas. The creators of every innovative video game and Hollywood animated film write custom software to enhance their work. 
Having an understanding about software allows you to think beyond the aesthetic prerequisites that come with existing digital tools (i.e. Adobe Creative Suite). It encourages you to use the computer as the generic tool maker that it is and promotes a way of thought that fosters a deeper engagement with the digital. 
This class aspires to lay the foundation for a deeper understanding of the digital, encouraging the use of the computer as a tool maker and showing its aesthetic and conceptual potentials in the broad range of the arts. It aspires to spark an enthusiasm that will result in a lasting engagement with the subject.

Attendance

More than one unexcused absences will lower your final grade by one unit (i.e. an A will become an B). With each additional unexcused absence, the grade will drop an additional unit. If you are 15 minutes late, you will receive a tardy. 3 tardies will turn into 1 absence.
