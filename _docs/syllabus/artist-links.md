### What is Art?

[Jeff Koons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTnPq0uIUds)<br>

>"What art is able to do, it's about acceptance. People talk about aesthetics and all of these different things, but what art really is is a vehicle of acceptance. First you accept yourself and eventually the highest state, is the acceptance of others."

[Wolfgang Laib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-_92MYcANk)<br>

>"The essence of all your experience is coming into an artwork, it is as simple as that and also as complicated as that."

[Hillary Llyod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZA16b8E07s)<br>

>"There's this idea about art that you should understand it, or that you should appreciate it, or that, you know, you should "get it", and all of those other things and I don't think its like that at all. I don't know, I don't think I know what the works are saying. Can you answer it and I think I'll see if I agree"
